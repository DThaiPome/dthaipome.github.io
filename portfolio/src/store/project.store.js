        summary: '<b>Trail of Crumbs</b> is a game produced for the Game Programming class at Northeastern University. It was developed over the span of two months by a team of four programmers, including myself. It is a first-person stealth game, in which the player must use a long-reach grapple hand to pull themself to hard-to-reach areas and navigate to a target point in each level. The player must avoid the many eyes trying to find and apprehend them, like spotlights, robot guards, and an aggressive train conductor. There are several interesting ways for the player to navigate through levels, including reverse-gravity fields and a power-up that lets the player reach farther with their grapple hand. In the end, the player must thwart smuggling efforts and eventually defeat the crime boss known as Crumbs Banks.<br><br>My focus on this project was on the different ways the player interacted with each level. Among other things, I wrote code for the grapple hand, the power-ups, the reverse-gravity fields, and the color-switching lights that are seen later in the game. My primary collaborative challenge was to develop game components that could be used by my teammates, and that would be compatible with the components my teammates developed. I accomplished this by making my components single-purpose and open-ended. As an example, the player\'s grapple hand is not dependent on a specific player object, but instead can be used when paired with any Unity object. Employing this strategy in my development helped reduce the number of conflicts that arose between two different programmers, and helped us produce a game with so many features in such a short amount of time.',
